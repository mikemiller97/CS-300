# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The problem being solved in the projects for this course was creating a data structure to store a list of courses, sort them, search them, and print them to the user.

# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I approached the problem by considering which data structure would best suit the data given in the project. Given that it is a few dozen classes, and searching them is very important, I decided to use a hashtable to store the data and fulfill all the needed functions.

# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

If I was having trouble implementing a certain concept, I would look up guides on how it is implemented. Similarly, I would solve bugs by looking up how they are solved for other people. For example, in my project when I was reading the text file I kept getting random characters inserted into the first read line. I found out by searching online that this is a problem with copying the BOM of the file. I inserted a function I found online that solved this problem.

# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

This project expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs by giving me practice in implementing more complex data storage methods than the standard array.

# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

THe rpoject helpved evolve the way I write programs to be more maintainable, readable, and adaptable by giving me practice making a program from scratch that is easily understood and edited by others.
